## Product Idea in Nutshell


Aim of this project is to solve our favourite restraurant Tarama perform better. Unfortunately Tarama with very limited seatings gets super crowded during afternoons and on Sundays. What to do then?

Well if you ask the restraurant owner the solution to this problem he would simply say First Come, First Serve! Well take group size in account and this fails!
Also if you're thinking of SJF, SRTF, Priority or Round Robin all fail here!

We devised a new algo(description to be added soon...) here to help solve this problem.

[Dhairya ](https://github.com/dhairyaostwal), I remember both of us spending long hours in discussing the steps in algorithm and then moving to write the code. We started with a cpp program and edited it so mant times. After a lot of debugging and we could finally implement it in a cpp program. Then, came the flask work. Converting it to python was a tedious part. Using the itertools library and combination function in python reduced our program by 25%. Also, your idea of making the pdf form of that report, made it more legitimate.
